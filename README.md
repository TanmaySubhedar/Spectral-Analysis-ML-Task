# Spectral-Analysis-ML-Task

This project demonstrates the process of analyzing and modeling data using machine learning techniques. The code is implemented in Jupyter notebooks and the results are visualized and analyzed step by step.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanmaySubhedar/Spectral-Analysis-ML-Task.git
cd Spectral-Analysis-ML-Task
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

It’s a good practice to create a virtual environment for managing dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:

```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```

- On **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary libraries needed for the project.

### 4. Run the Code

After setting up the environment, open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to execute the code.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

In the Jupyter interface, navigate to your notebook and run the code.
